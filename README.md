# Privacy-Preserving-InductiveMiner
This is an approximation of the original Inductive-Miner. With this approximation privacy-preserving, Process-Structure-Trees are generated by altering the type of cut made.

PM4PY (https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de/) and Python 3.9 are required to execute the algorithm. To install PM4PY, use the command: 'python -m pip install pm4py', under Windows.

After the installation of PM4PY, the algorithm can be executed. For that, an event log is needed as an input file. This file has to be of type '.csv' or '.xes'. After the given input file, you must give an epsilon value. This value should be at most 2 and no smaller than 0.5 to get the best result.
